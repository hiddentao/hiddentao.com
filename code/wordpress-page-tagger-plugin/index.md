## Usage

To add tags to a page simply edit the page. You will see a tagging box on on the right-hand side which works exactly like the one you see when you edit a blog post. It should look something like this (assuming you're using the default admin theme for Wordpress 2.8):

Furthermore, when viewing the archives for a given tag you will now see the associated pages as well as the blog posts.

Page tags will also appear within the tag cloud widget.
