{% capture markdown %}
This is a simple 3D graphics engine I've written in Java 1.5 using the Swing windowing toolkit and parts of the Java2D API. It supports the following features:

* Hierarchical scenegraph including `Mesh`, `Rotation`, `Translation` and `Light` nodes.  
* Triangle primitives with helpers for building cubes  
* UVN camera with orthographic or perspective projection  
* Timer scheduler for animating the scene.  
* Rendering system abstraction  
* Renderers follow `Visitor` design pattern  
* Software-based renderer  
* Wireframe/flat shading  
* Simple directional light  
* Backface culling  
* Pixel-level z-buffer  
* Customizable interaction (i.e. user input) handlers
