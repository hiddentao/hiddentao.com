I've recently released [Melkor](https://github.com/hiddentao/melkor), a wiki engine built in Node.js. Melkor (named after the [Lord of the Rings character](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Melkor)) uses Git as the back-end storage mechanism (including revision history), has a responsive layout (using Bootstrap) and has support for AJAX page navigation built-in (making it fast to use on mobiles).

The wiki content format is Markdown. The back-end is built using [Waigo](http://waigojs.com), a web framework that utilises Javascript ES6 features such as generators.
