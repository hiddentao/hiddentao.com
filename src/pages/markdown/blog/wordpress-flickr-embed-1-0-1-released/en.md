Just released a minor update to the [Wordpress Flickr Embed](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-flickr-embed/) plugin. You can now sort search results by 'date taken' or 'date posted', the same criteria available within Flickr. This will make it easier to find the photo you want, particularly when searching through your own photosets.
