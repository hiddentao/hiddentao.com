A new version of [Page Tagger](/code/wordpress-page-tagger-plugin/) is now available. Grab it now from [here](/code/wordpress-page-tagger-plugin/) or the [Wordpress plugin repository](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/page-tagger/).

Also, I've put up a few Java classes I wrote a while back as a small library called [Common-Utils](/code/common-utils/ "Common-Utils"). Included within are the following:

* ``ArrayUtils`` - Utility methods to fill an array with a given value or check if it contains a given value.
* ``DynamicArray`` - A resizable "static" array for when you don't quite need the full flexibility of ``ArrayList``.
* ``NonMutableIterator`` - Wraps around a normal ``Iterator`` and disables use of the ``remove`` method.
