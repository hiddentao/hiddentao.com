I'm pleased to announce the immediate availability of [Wordpress Flickr Embed](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-flickr-embed/), a plugin which makes it _really_ easy to insert Flickr images into your Wordpress posts.

The plugin is very user-friendly. It adds a button to the editing toolbar which will pop up an interactive interface when clicked. The interface lets you search for photos using free text. Click on a photo to insert it and customise the title/caption, inserted size, alignment and also the size to show in the lightbox. It also provides a mechanism (on its settings page) for you to authenticate it with your Flickr account so that you can access your private images.

After much searching trying to find something which would do this for me I came across [Wordpress Media Flickr](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-media-flickr/), an excellent plugin from the initial looks of it. I would have just used this but I couldn't get it to work properly with my blog. As of writing this (Nov 13, 2012) it hasn't been updated in over a year and there are still outstanding support requests. Plus it lacks features I need, like the ability to have the lightbox popup use a larger version of the clicked photo. After fixing some bugs I ended up adding this feature and others and so decided to fork it.

If you have any support requests please enter them on the plugin's [Wordpress Support](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-flickr-embed) page. Source code is at [https://github.com/hiddentao/wp-flickr-embed](https://github.com/hiddentao/wp-flickr-embed).

Enjoy!
