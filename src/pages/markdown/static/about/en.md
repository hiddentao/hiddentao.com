## 2005 - 2012

I graduated (1st Hons.) from Imperial College London in 2005. Prior to graduation I did a couple of internships. At Morgan Stanley I was involved in building a grid-computing
system for parallelizing calculation workload. At IBM my efforts were concentrated
in the WebSphere team, building with Java Enterprise Edition tech.

Post-graduation I  spent a year and a half working at Symbian Ltd, on
low-level libraries for the real-time Symbian mobile OS. I then moved onto
work at Blue Whale Systems Ltd, an angel-backed startup focussing on bringing
the Blackberry email experience to every other mobile.

In 2009 I moved into web development contracting, initially as a PHP developer
(with the occasional Python) and then subsequently moved into Node.js and
Javascript in general.

## 2012 - 2016

After contracting for 3 years I decided to leave London and go travelling for
a while in Asia. In 2013 I ended up in Taiwan studying Chinese part-time. I liked
it so much I ended up staying for many years, making a living as a remote freelancer,
still working mainly with Node.js and Javascript, and newly, Blockchain
technology.

## 2016 - present

I returned to London in October 2016 with the intention of establishing a more
permanent presence there.

I got back into contracting and am currently working in the Ethereum space. I
also setup a company - [Kickback](https://kickback.events) - with 2 friends, initially funded via an
incubator. Along with this I am now focussed on building my own products and
services in a quest to leave contracting behind and live a more remote-friendly
lifestyle.
