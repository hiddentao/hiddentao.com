I'm Ram, a passionate coder from Britain, currently living and working in London, UK.

I am a full stack developer with over 10 years experience consulting with clients in various industries, including software, public advocacy, media and film as well as education.

I graduated (1st Hons.) from Imperial College London in 2005. Prior to graduation I did a couple of internships. At Morgan Stanley I was involved in building a grid-computing 
system for parallelizing calculation workload. At IBM my efforts were concentrated 
in the WebSphere team, building with Java Enterprise Edition tech. 

Post-graduation I  spent a year and a half working at Symbian Ltd, on 
low-level libraries for the real-time Symbian mobile OS. I then moved onto 
work at Blue Whale Systems Ltd, an angle-backed startup focussing on brining 
the Blackberry email experience to every other mobile.

In 2009 I moved into web development contracting, initially as a PHP developer 
(with the occasional Python) and then subsequently moved into Node.js and 
Javascript in general.

After contracting for 3 years I decided to leave London and go travelling for 
a while in Asia. In 2013 I ended up in Taiwan studying Chinese part-time. I liked 
it so much I ended up staying for many years, making a living as a remote freelancer, 
still working mainly with Node.js and Javascript, and newly, Blockchain 
technology.

__2016 onwards...__

I returned to London in October 2016 with the intention of establishing a more 
permanent presence there.

I intend to build my own apps and eventually be an entrepreneur, leaving the 
consulting life behind. I love building and creating, and thus, building my own 
apps and ideas is where I'll truly be able to flourish.

I also have an interest in philosophy and how it can help us live happier lives.
