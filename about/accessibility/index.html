<p>This is the official accessibility statement for <strong>HiddenTao.com<&#47;strong>. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to [contact me]([phpx:SITE_URI]&#47;about&#47;contact&#47; "Get in touch").</p>
<p>### Standards compliance ###</p>
<p>1. All pages on this site validate as [HTML 5](http:&#47;&#47;www.w3.org&#47;TR&#47;2011&#47;WD-html5-20110525&#47; "View the HTML5 specification").<br />
2. All pages on this site use structured semantic markup. For example, if the main heading of a page uses a H1 tag, then subheadings will use a lower level tag such as H2, H3, etc.<br />
3.  I've tried to ensure that the site complies with the following standards, although admittedly it does not yet fully comply with all of them (more work needed!):<br />
   - [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](http:&#47;&#47;www.w3.org&#47;TR&#47;WAI-WEBCONTENT&#47; "View specification for WCAG").<br />
   - [Section 508 Guidelines](http:&#47;&#47;www.section508.gov&#47; "View Section 508 website").</p>
<p>### Links ###</p>
<p>1. Many links have *title* attributes which describe the link in greater detail, unless the text of the link already fully describes the target (such as the headline of an article).<br />
2. Most links are written to make sense out of context as well as in context.<br />
3. Helper icons get appended to the end of the link text to indicate the effect of clicking certain links:<br />
   - Links to external sites are indicated by: <a class="link-external-no-text"><&#47;a><br />
   - Links which open in a new window are indicated by: <a class="link-newwindow-no-text"><&#47;a></p>
<p>### Images ###</p>
<p>1. Most images used on this site include descriptive ALT attributes. Purely decorative graphics include null ALT attributes.</p>
<p>### Visual design ###</p>
<p>   1. This site uses cascading style sheets for visual layout.<br />
   2. This site uses relative font sizes as much as possible in order to be compatible with the user-specified "text size" option in visual browsers.<br />
   3. If your browser or browsing device does not support stylesheets at all, the content of each page is still readable.</p>
