I've been thinking lately about the next step.

Nearly four years ago I left London to travel in Asia and eventually landed in Taiwan, where I've now been for 3 years. Along the way I've traded in my daily commute to become a remote freelancer. I love working this way. I get to use my skills to help companies and people, no matter where on the globe they might be. On the flip side I am able to organize my time the way I want, and be where I want to be, doing what I want to do.

It has taken me time to truly understand that this is the way I'd like to work going forward. And freelance job insecurity notwithstanding, the sense of freedom I currently have is something I treat as sacred. Because I spent so many years working without it.

Now I want to step up my game. I've realized that whether I'm in London or Taiwan isn't really what matters to me. What matters is what I'm doing with my time. I want to start working on more projects that matter, on technology that pushes me out of my comfort zone, and with people who will inspire me.

My larger strategy involves increasing my public profile as a developer. In the medium term I plan on releasing more [open source software](https://github.com/hiddentao) and building a few more of my own ideas. My long-term future goal is to work on my own businesses, and build a passive income stream that frees up my time to work on whatever whacky idea comes to mind.

My philosophy is simple. Life is short. So if there's something you're passionate about and really want to do, just do it. Even if you don't believe you can do it, just get started. Take small steps, make mistakes, learn, and the self-belief will come with time.
