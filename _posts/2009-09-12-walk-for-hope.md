<p>Be The Cause run an annual event called the **Walk for Hope** which raises money for various charities as well as inspiring people in the process. They wanted to replace their existing website with something which had a lot more functionality. Specifically, the general requirements were:</p>
<p>  * User should be able to register on the site either as charities or as walkers (people intending to join the walk). Administrators must approve a charity before it becomes visible.<br />
  * Anybody should be able pledge money towards a charity (although the actual payment would be handled on the charity's website itself).<br />
  * All registered users should be able to edit their profile details and upload a profile picture.<br />
  * It should be possible to search for specific walkers or charities.<br />
  * Administrators should be able to edit and delete any walker or charity as well as be able to see all pledges made.</p>
<p>I had input into designing the page layout, however the front-end colour scheme was heavily customised by the client to their liking. Key features or project:</p>
<p>*  CodeIgniter MVC framework, MySQL back-end. XHTML and CSS.<br />
*  User registration and configuration. Ability to assign administrator privileges to users.<br />
*  Integration with reCAPTCHA API to provide 'Are you human?' tests.</p>
