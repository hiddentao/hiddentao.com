title: Getting page tags to show on your Wordpress pages
excerpt: "A number of users of [Page Tagger](&#47;code&#47;wordpress-page-tagger-plugin&#47;)
  have emailed in asking how to get their page tags showing on their pages. So I thought
  I'd put up a short blog post on how to do this.\r\n\r\nOnce you've happily tagged
  your pages using Page Tagger you need to edit your theme's `page.php` template.
  This is the [template which gets used by Wordpress](http:&#47;&#47;codex.wordpress.org&#47;Pages#What_Template_is_used_to_Display_a_Particular_Page.3F)

    <p>Hi.
    I'm using Page Tagger with WP-Cumulus.
    I want it to go to the page with the tag, and not as now to a page with a summary. Is that possible ?

A number of users of [Page Tagger](/code/wordpress-page-tagger-plugin/) have emailed in asking how to get their page tags showing on their pages. So I thought I'd put up a short blog post on how to do this.

Once you've happily tagged your pages using Page Tagger you need to edit your theme's `page.php` template. This is the [template which gets used by Wordpress](http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages#What_Template_is_used_to_Display_a_Particular_Page.3F) whenever you view a static page (as opposed to a blog post) on your site.
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-771"></a>
Inside this file you should have a section resembling ["The Loop"](http://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop):

```php
<? php if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ? >
...

```

Inside this section you need to place a call to the `the_tags()` template method. This will output your page tags at that spot with some default formatting. Read the [documentation for the_tags()](http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/the_tags) for information on changing how it works. You can also use alternative functions such as `get_the_tags()`or `get_the_tag_list()` to achieve a similar effect.

If for some reason your page tags still aren't showing on your page then please get in touch as it maybe a bug in the Page Tagger plugin.
