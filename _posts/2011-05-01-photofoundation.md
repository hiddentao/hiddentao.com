<p>This was an enhancement to the existing PhotoFoundation website, where users donate money in order to download photos other people have uploaded. The requirement of my work was for the user to be able to set the amount they wanted to donate for an item, with the minimum acceptable amount for an item to be pre-set by an admin. I implemented a custom version of the uc_donation module to fulfill these requirements.</p>
<p>Key features of site:</p>
<p>*  Javascript-enhanced client-side form UI to make up for things we couldn't do using Drupal hooks.<br />
*  Custom back-end module (based on [uc_donation](http:&#47;&#47;drupal.org&#47;project&#47;uc_donation)) which provides support for donation - i.e. user-set-pricing  - products.</p>
