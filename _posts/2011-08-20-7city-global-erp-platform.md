<p>7city hired me to help improve and modernize and improve their internal software development process as well as to contribute to general bug fixing and feature enhancement for their PHP 5 Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platform. </p>
<p>I discussed priorities and possible solutions for improving 7city's development process with the development team. Once targets were agreed I then lead the development of a user-friendly company-wide issue&#47;bug tracking system which integrated with the [Redmine](http:&#47;&#47;www.redmine.org&#47;) issue tracking system at the back-end. As well as designing and building the ERP UI and the associated business logic this involved improving Redmine itself and writing a plugin to enable push notifications of issue updates (see [here](https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;hiddentao&#47;redmine-1) and [here](https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;hiddentao&#47;updates_notifier)). I introduced  [Jenkins](http:&#47;&#47;jenkins-ci.org&#47;) for continuous integration and deployment purposes and trained the development team on its use. I also developed an in-house solution for controlled deployment of database migrations.</p>
<p>I introduced greater use of jQuery and associated plugins (especially [DataTables](http:&#47;&#47;datatables.net&#47;)) and made it easy to re-use this functionality for their standard data reports. I also helped to prototype an AJAX-driven GUI for on-demand loading of large datasets (>25,000 rows).</p>
<p>On the server maintenance side I helped to setup and configure Amazon EC2 instances and I successfully constructed [Vagrant](http:&#47;&#47;vagrantup.com&#47;) developer Virtual Machines using [Puppet](http:&#47;&#47;puppetlabs.com&#47;) scripts for provisioning. </p>
<p>I also helped setup a *business process continuity* site using Drupal - [7cbcp.com](http:&#47;&#47;www.7cbcp.com) - which needed to be integrated with a third-party SMS service (PHP code available [here](https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;hiddentao&#47;bulksms)).</p>
