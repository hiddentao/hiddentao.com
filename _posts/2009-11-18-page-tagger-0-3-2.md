This is a new version of [Page Tagger](/code/wordpress-page-tagger-plugin/) that has been tested to work with Wordpress 2.8.6.

Some users were reporting that the tag editing interface was unusable when used in conjunction with certain other plugins (e.g. the multi-level navigation plugin). Other users were having trouble getting the plugin to work in the latest version of Wordpress (2.8.6). This release (hopefully) fixes these issues.

Grab it now from [here](/code/wordpress-page-tagger-plugin/) or the [Wordpress plugin repository](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/page-tagger/).

**Update (Nov20):** The plugin has been updated to 0.3.3 now. This fixes a callback bug which was preventing the plugin from initialising on certain installations.
