I'd like to announce the immediate availability of [Squel.js](http://squeljs.org/), a lightweight Javascript library for building SQL query strings. Squel exposes an object-oriented API for building SQL query strings in a server-side or browser-side Javascript environment. It's well tested using [Vows](http://vowsjs.org/) and is available for forking on [github](https://github.com/hiddentao/squel).

Full documentation along with in-browser examples are available at [squeljs.org](http://squeljs.org/). To get started with using Squel in your node.js program use `npm install squel`.

Enjoy :)

**Update:** I've created a [Prezi for Squel](http://prezi.com/8fdvjo6ripkw/squeljs/) which gives you an overview!

**Update:** I recently gave a [talk on Squel](/archives/2012/03/02/my-talk-on-squel-js-at-the-london-node-js-user-group/) at the [London Node.js User Group](http://lnug.org/) meetup.
