<p>My Three Words is a social experiment to observe whether the collaborative story writing concept (see [blog posting]([php:SITE_URI]&#47;archives&#47;2010&#47;03&#47;31&#47;my-three-words&#47;)) would gain traction with web surfers. From a technical point of view it can be seen as a multi-user realtime collaborative story writing system.</p>
<p>I built the site using the Kohana3 MVC framework, coupled with Memcached and MySQL for data storage. The site makes heavy use of AJAX. The site allows users to share user generated content via Twitter and Facebook. There is also an administration back-end which allows for user entries to be censored and re-used in future content. Sound effects in the web page come courtesy of the [SoundManager 2](http:&#47;&#47;www.schillmania.com&#47;projects&#47;soundmanager2&#47;) project.</p>
<p>I also developed the Facebook application - [http:&#47;&#47;apps.facebook.com&#47;mythreewords&#47;](http:&#47;&#47;apps.facebook.com&#47;mythreewords&#47;) - incorporating the Facebook Javascript APIs and XFBML code to provide basic social networking functionality such as sending friend invitiations.</p>
<p>Key features of project:</p>
<p>*  Kohana 3 MVC framework + Memcached for high performance.<br />
*  Implemented designs using XHTML, CSS and long-polling AJAX (jQuery).<br />
*  Twitter and Facebook integration (Facebook Canvas application).<br />
*  Administration interface with ability to moderate user entries.<br />
*  Widget for embedding main chat box onto third-party sites with minimal code.</p>
