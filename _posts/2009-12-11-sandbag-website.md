<p>Sandbag Climate Campaign wanted to improve and enhance their website. I was partly responsible for maintenance and improvement of the website and contributed numerous enhancements to make the website and infrastructure better for both users and administrators.</p>
<p> * An automated build system and functional tests to ensure payment systems integration (Google Checkout, Paypal) was working correctly.<br />
 * Membership-related features: forum access, a membership report for admins showing a breakdown of petition signatories, payments made, permit certificate requirements, etc.<br />
 * Helped to build a public data API (outputs XML or JSON) for carbon emission data (see it: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;sandbag.org.uk&#47;countries&#47;index.json">json<&#47;a>,  <a href="http:&#47;&#47;sandbag.org.uk&#47;countries&#47;index.xml">xml<&#47;a>).<br />
 * Helped to build a global "power map" utilising Google Maps (<a href="http:&#47;&#47;sandbag.org.uk&#47;carbondata&#47;carma_top95">see it<&#47;a>).<br />
 * A page for users to download CO2 emissions data from the Sandbag database (<a href="http:&#47;&#47;sandbag.org.uk&#47;carbondata&#47;data">see it<&#47;a>).<br />
 * Embeddable widgets utilising good use of XHTML, CSS and JavaScript (<a href="http:&#47;&#47;sandbag.org.uk&#47;embeddable_widgets&#47;demo">see it<&#47;a>).<br />
 * A Drupal module which allowed for Sandbag to setup 'public actions', e.g. online petitions which could be signed by users and then sent to one or more intended recipients ([see it](http:&#47;&#47;sandbag.org.uk&#47;notdoneyet)).</p>
